\arguments{
\item{rt}{A vector of response times (in seconds). If a response time is
non-positve, then its density will evaluate to \eqn{0} if log = FALSE and
\ifelse{html}{\out{-<font style="vertical-align: middle;"
size="5em">&#8734;</font>}}{\eqn{-\infty}} if log = TRUE.}

\item{response}{Binary response(s) that correspond(s) to either the "lower"
or "upper" threshold. This model parameter can either be a singular value
or a vector. The value(s) in 'response' can be of the following data
types:
  \itemize{
    \item integers or doubles (\eqn{1}
      \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} "lower", \eqn{2}
      \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} "upper");
    \item factors (the first level gets mapped to "lower", and the second
      level gets mapped to "upper"; any additional levels are ignored).
    \item strings (only the first character is checked, "L"
      \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} "lower" or "U"
      \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} "upper", case insensitive);
    \item logicals (FALSE \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} "lower",
      TRUE \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} "upper");
  }}

\item{a}{Threshold separation. Amount of information that is considered for
a decision. Large values indicate a conservative decisional style. Allowed
range: \eqn{0 <} \code{a}. Typical range: \eqn{0.5 <} \code{a} \eqn{< 2}.}

\item{v}{Drift rate. Average slope of the information accumulation process.
The drift gives information about the speed and direction of the
accumulation of information. Large (absolute) values of drift indicate a
good performance. If received information supports the response linked to
the upper threshold, then the sign will be positive; similarly a negative
value indicates that the received information supports the response linked
to the lower threshold. Allowed range: \code{v} is a real number. Typical
range: \eqn{-5 <} \code{v} \eqn{< 5}.}

\item{t0}{Non-decision time or response time constant (in seconds). Lower
bound for the duration of all non-decisional processes (encoding and
response execution). If this value is greater than \code{rt}, then the
resulting density is returned as if \code{rt} \eqn{ \le 0}. Allowed range:
\eqn{0 \le} \code{t0}. Typical range: \eqn{0.1 <} \code{t0} \eqn{< 0.5}.}

\item{w}{Relative starting point. Indicator of an a priori bias in decision
making. When the relative starting point \code{w} deviates from \eqn{0.5},
the amount of information necessary for a decision differs between
response alternatives. Allowed range: \eqn{0 <} \code{w} \eqn{< 1}.
Default value is \eqn{0.5} (i.e., no bias).}

\item{sv}{Inter-trial-variability of drift rate. Standard deviation of a
normal distribution with mean \code{v} describing the distribution of
actual drift rates from specific trials. Values different from \eqn{0} can
predict slow errors. Allowed range: \eqn{0 \le} \code{sv}. Typical range:
\eqn{0 <} \code{sv} \eqn{< 2}. Default value is \eqn{0}, which indicates
no drift in the function call. See Details for more information.}

\item{sigma}{Diffusion coefficient of the underlying Wiener process. Allowed
range: \eqn{0 <} \code{sigma}. Default value is \eqn{1}. This parameter
simply scales the parameters \code{a}, \code{v}, and \code{sv} as follows.
See Details for more information. \itemize{ \item \code{a}
\ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} \code{a} \eqn{/} \code{sigma}
\item \code{v} \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}} \code{v} \eqn{/}
\code{sigma} \item \code{sv} \ifelse{html}{\out{&#8594;}}{\eqn{\to}}
\code{sv} \eqn{/} \code{sigma} }.}

\item{sl_thresh}{Threshold for deciding when to use the "small-time" variant
or the "large-time" variant in one half of the calculation of the partial
derivative of the density function. This acts in exactly the same way as
the parameter \code{max_terms_large} in the \code{dfddm()} function: it is
the maximum number of terms to use for the "large-time" variant before
switching to using the "small-time" variant. The other half of the
calculation leverages a different type of comparison between the
"large-time" and "small-time" variants that requires no input from the
user. Allowed values are any real number; however any non-positive number
means that the "small-time" variant will always be used. Similarly, any
very large positive number (e.g., +Inf) means that the "large-time"
variant will always be used. Default value is \eqn{1}.}

\item{err_tol}{Allowed error tolerance of the overall calculation. Since the
partial derivative of the density function contains the sum of two
infinite sums, each approximation of these two infinite sums will have an
individual error tolerance of \code{err_tol} / 2; thus the total overall
error of the calculation will be at most \code{err_tol}. Default is
\eqn{1e-6}.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the partial derivatives of the DDM PDF with
  precision \code{err_tol} whose length matches that of the longest input
  parameter (usually \code{rt}).
}
\description{
Partial Derivative of the density function for the 5-parameter variant of
  the Ratcliff diffusion decision model (DDM) with respect to w, the initial
  bias. This variant contains the following parameters:
  \code{a} (threshold separation), \code{v} (drift rate),
  \code{t0} (non-decision time/response time constant), \code{w}
  (relative starting point), \code{sv} (inter-trial variability of drift),
  and \code{sigma} (diffusion coefficient of underlying Wiener process).
}
\details{
All of the model inputs and parameters (\code{rt}, \code{response},
\code{a}, \code{v}, \code{t0}, \code{w}, \code{sv}, \code{sigma}) can be
input as a single value or as a vector of values. If input as a vector of
values, then the standard \code{R} input wrapping will occur.

\code{sv} - Both the "small-time" and "large-time" variants of the density
function have two further variants: one with a constant drift rate \code{v}
(i.e., \code{sv} \eqn{= 0}), and one with a variable drift rate \code{v}
(i.e., \code{sv} \eqn{> 0}). The details of the differences between these
two density functions can be found in our associated paper. To use the
density function with a constant drift rate, leave the parameter \code{sv}
to its default value of \code{sv = 0}, as this will indicate no drift to the
function. To use the density function with a variable drift rate, set the
parameter \code{sv} to some non-negative value, i.e., \code{sv} \eqn{> 0}.

\code{sigma} - The default value of this parameter is \code{1} because it
only scales the parameters \code{a}, \code{v}, and \code{sv}, as shown
above. However, other formulations of the DDM may set \code{sigma = 0.1}
(see Ratcliff (1978), the fourth reference), so care must be taken when
comparing the results of different formulations.
